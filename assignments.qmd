### Question 3

The following is an example of a graphic found in the article [**Mapping the Political Landscape: Toward a GIS Analysis of Environmental and Social Difference**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10816-011-9126-z#Fig7)

The graphic shows the location of buildings and terraces over space, with some specific location labels to add more data. The biggest hindrance to the success of this graphic is the limited use of color, font and texture. It is not easy to distinguish between pieces of information in the graphic since it is largely just dependent on line thickness. Black font on top of multiple types of black elements, over a grey scale background ultimately make a cluttered and confusing display that seems overly compacted. The strict border imposed on the graphic makes it well contain but also contributes to this feeling. The location identifiers around the map are both repeated and not necessary for the information displayed. An inset map could be employed instead as a separate graphic. The text over the graphic adds limited value as well. They are meant to represent building type areas, but without any boundaries visible or a link to specific buildings, they add almost no novel data.
